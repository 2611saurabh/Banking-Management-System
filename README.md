# Banking  Management System using Swing and Database![atm](https://github.com/2611saurabh/Banking-Management-System/assets/65698100/7ed2b44b-a9bd-4638-b03b-30f897f79f89)


## Overview

This project aims to develop a management system using Java with a Swing-based GUI for the user interface and a database to store and manage data efficiently.

## Features

- User-friendly interface using Swing for smooth user interactions.
- Database integration to store, retrieve, and manage data persistently.
- Various management features tailored to specific needs (e.g., employee management, inventory management, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language for development.
- **Swing**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)**: To store and manage data.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: For connecting and interacting with the database.
- **Maven or Gradle**: Dependency management and build tool.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Ensure you have Java and the necessary IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) installed.

3. Set up the database:

   - Install a suitable database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Create the required database and tables as per the application's needs.

4. Configure database connection:

   - Update the database connection settings in the application to match your database setup.

5. Build and run the application:

   - Build the project using Maven or Gradle.
   - Run the application from your chosen IDE.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.

2. Navigate through the user interface to access different management features.

3. Perform actions like adding, editing, and deleting records as required.
